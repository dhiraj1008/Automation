by writing few lines of python code with using the openpyxl python package we are able to
automate 1000 of spreadsheets in a second and also able to apply the graph

steps we need to follow->
1)we need to install the openpyxl package ;
  i)type "pip install openpyxl" on the pycharm(ide) terminal
2)And then add the excel sheets into the 'excelworlbook'(empty dir) or add excel workbook
  to the project directory
3)then find the updated thing you need to update on the excel sheets and  modify the loop
  along with the operation which u need to perform on to the sheets
4)Now u can automate the process of excel spreadsheets and within a second u can do the update along with the charts (graph) which requires days or
  a week to do for 1000 or more sheets ..!

#Happy coding stars :)...!
